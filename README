Something like .htaccess for lighttpd.
Some features is not supported (like RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f),
but still makes live with lighty much easier.

How to install:

1) Put enable-sites.pl in /usr/share/lighttpd

2) Append to the end of lighttpd.conf following line:
   include_shell "/usr/share/lighttpd/enable-sites.pl"
